# E-Commerce Web App Project-3

This application allows users to view an online stores given products and add them to the cart. If the user chooses, they can create an account in order to keep track of their order history as well as store their shipping information. If the user so chooses they can also check out as guest but will not be able to view their previous orders. This application will be our third and final project for UNCCs full stack web development bootcamp. The project is a way to display all of the various skills we have learned throughout the bootcamp as we will be implementing almost all them. The goal of the project is to familiarize ourselves and further our understand of real world technologies common to the field.
